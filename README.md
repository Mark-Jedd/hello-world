Just trying to get a handle on GitHub...and life
These days, I find myself struggling with the concept of hope. I believe it is tied into my mortal fear of disappointment and the need to rid myself of it completely. For without hope, there is no expectation and subsequently, no room to be disappointed. While this rationalization works in my head, I've been unable to stop my heart from hoping. It is a constant fight.
